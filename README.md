# React Native - Expo 

### :information_desk_person: Welcome to the Native Project App! This app is being built using Expo and the JSearch API from RapidAPI, which are both powerful tools that will help us create the best user experience possible.

 :bulb:The app will be built using React Native, which is a popular platform for developing mobile applications. Expo is a set of tools and services that help developers create high-quality apps quickly and easily. By using Expo, we can focus on building great features while Expo takes care of the heavy lifting.

:bulb:The JSearch API is a powerful tool for searching a wide range of data sources. It provides access to a variety of search engines and news sources, making it the perfect tool for our app. With the JSearch API, we can provide users with the most relevant search results possible.
